# This is my website.

Or at least an attempt at it for now. I'm exploring things that are relatively new for me, from deploying a [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) static website through [Github Actions](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/deployment/github-pages/), to embedding WASM-compiled rust code of a [simple cellular automata](https://github.com/thelazyone/Bacter/) into the background of a [Zola theme](https://github.com/svavs/particle-zola), to mixing together two themes (admittedly messy) to add some blogging fetures to an otherwise showcase-only website.

The test build is currently deployed on [this page](https://thelazyone.github.io/lazy_blog/).

TODOs:

- [ ] Reorganize the CSS files
- [ ] Separate the blogging Html and CSS files from the others
- [ ] Even out the style of the two parts (they are using different fonts now!)
- [ ] Write something - anything - in the blog.
- [ ] Remove the corporate-y notes at the bottom of the homepage, replace them with something a bit smarter.
