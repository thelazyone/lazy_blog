## Bacter Evolution Simulator

An evolution simulator that models a digital Petri dish where cellular automata compete for resources and reproduction. This project explores how evolutionary pressures can create complex behaviors from simple rules.

### Key Features
- Cellular automata simulation
- Competitive evolution mechanics
- Dynamic parameter optimization
- Real-time visualization
